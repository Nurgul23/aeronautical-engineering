** Lecture 1: Introduction and Ballooning

*** Gas Law

*Base Formulas*

$p V = n R  T$

  p: pressure PA
  V: Volume m^3
  n: Number of moles
  R: Universial Gas constant in $\frac{J}{mol * K}$
  T: Temperature K

$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$ => $V = \frac{m}{\rho}$

  $\rho$: density
  m: mass
  V: Volume

$m = n M$ => $n = \frac{m}{M}$

  n: number of mols
  M: mass per mol

*Combine to eliminate V and n*

$n = \frac{m}{M}$

$p \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{m}{M} * R * T$

$\frac{p}{\rho} = \frac{R}{M} T$ => $p = \rho \frac{R}{M}T$

$\frac{R}{M}$: specific gas constant $R_{specific}$, dependent on gas type only

$p = \rho R_{specific} T$ (equation of state)

R: specific gas constant

$R_{specific} = 287.00 \frac{J}{kg K}$ for air

*** Ballooning

Volume of air/gas.

max force $F_L = m g = \rho_{air} V g$ with $m = \rho V$

ballon $F_L = \rho_{air} V g - \rho_{gas} V g - F_{gplayload}$

lift of balloon: $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$

assumption: $p_{inside} = p_{outside}$ (true for some ballons, but not all)

$\rho_1 \frac{R}{M_1} T_1 = \rho_2 \frac{R}{M_2} T_2$ => $\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \frac{M_1}{M_2}$

*gas ballon:*

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$ => $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{M_{gas}}{M_{air}} )$

M_he = 4.0 g/mol
M_air = 28.97 g/mol
M_h2 = 2.0 g/mol

ratio (air helium): 1/7

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g * \frac{6}{7}$

*for hot air balloon*

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$ => $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{T_{atm}}{T_{gas}} )$

with $T_{gas} = T_{atm} + \Delta T$

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{T}{T + \Delta T} )$
$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( \frac{T + \Delta T}{T + \Delta T} - \frac{T}{T + \Delta T} )$
$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g \frac{\Delta T}{T + \Delta T}$

to get same amount of lift as helium ballon:

$\frac{\Delta T}{T + \Delta T} = 6/7$ => $\Delta T = 6 T$ => lift of hot air usually much smaller then helium


** Lecture 2: The Standard Atmosphere
*** standard athmosphere I
as a function of altitude we need:
- pressure p [Pa]
- air density $\rho$ [kg/m^3]
- temperature T [K]

physically correct, so it obeys
- equation of state: $p = \rho R T$ R = 287.00 J/kgK
- pressure increase due to gravity

model athmosphere:
- weather ignored

$\Sigma F_{down} = \Sigma F_{up}$
$mg + (p + \Delta p) A = p A$
$\rho \cdot A \cdot \Delta h \cdot g = p A - p A - \Delta p A$
$\rho \cdot \Delta h \cdot g = - \Delta p$
$\Delta p = - \rho \cdot g \cdot \Delta h$ (only true for small discs, small delta, small altitude)
$dp = -\rho\ g\ dh$

two equations:
- equation of state: $p = \rho R T$
- hydrostatic equation: $dp = -\rho\ g\ dh$

needed:
- need to define temperature as function of altitude
- define start value for pressure

Sea level (h = 0m):
$p_0 = 101325\ Pa$
$T_0 = 15^{\circ} C = 288.15K$
$\rho_0 = 1.225 \frac{kg}{m^3}$

*** standard athmosphere II
$dp = - \frac{p}{R T}\ g\ dh$
$\frac{1}{p}dp = - \frac{g}{RT} dh$

$T_1 = T_0 + a(h_1 - h_0)$ (formula of Toussaint)

$a = \frac{dT}{dh}$
$dh = \frac{dT}{a}$

$\frac{1}{p} dp = - \frac{g}{R} \frac{1}{T} \frac{dT}{a}$

$\int_{p_0}^{p_1} \frac{1}{p} dp = - \frac{g}{aR} \int_{T_0}^{T_1} \frac{1}{T} dT$


$\ln p_1 - \ln p_0 = - \frac{g}{aR} (\ln T_1 - \ln T_0)$

$e^{\ln p_1 - \ln p_0} = e^{-\frac{g}{a R}(\ln T_1 - ln T_0)}$

$\frac{e^{\ln p_1}}{e^{\ln p_0}} = (e^{\ln T_1 - \ln T_0})^{-\frac{g}{a R}}$

$\frac{p_1}{p_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R}}$ with $p = \rho R T$

$\frac{\rho_1 R T_1}{\rho_0 R T_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R}}$

$\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R} - 1}$ works only for a != 0, need separate equation for isothermal layer.

unit of a: K/m

for isothermal layer:
$\frac{p_1}{p_0} = e^{- \frac{g}{R T} (h_1 - h_0)}$

$\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} = e^{- \frac{g}{R T} (h_1 - h_0)}$

*** Geopotential and Geometric altitude
- geopotential altitude h , assumption g0 = constant
- geometric altitude h_g, g varies

$g_0 = \frac{G M_e}{R_e^2}$

$g = \frac{G M_e}{(R_e + h_G)^2}$

$\frac{g}{g_0} = \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_G)^2}$

$dh = \frac{g}{g_0}dh_g = \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_g)^2} dh_g$

$\int_0^h dh = \int_0^{h_g} \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_g)^2} dh_g$

$h = \frac{R_e}{R_e + h_g} h_g$

$R_e = 6378000m = 6378km$
** Lecture 3: How aircraft fly
Forces on aircraft:
- lift L <=> weight W
- thrust T <=> drag D

$L=W$
$T=D$

*** Lift

$L = C_L \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 S$ in Newton!!!

$C_L$   = Lift coefficient [no dimension]
$\rho$    = Air density [kg/m^3]
$V$   = velocity [m/s]
$S$   = Wing surface area [m^2]

Lift coefficient $C_L$:
- efficiency of the airfoil in generating lift
- depends on airfoil and angle of attack
- airfoil described by NACA notation
- thickness, camber, chrord, thickness

Where does the lift come from?
- Bernoulli's law: sum of static and dynamic pressure is constant
  $p + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 = constant$
- Higher velocity means lower pressure
- Nasa foilsim

Take off and landing:
- less lift because speed is low
- add high lift devices
- flaps back of wing
- slats front of wing

*** Drag

$D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S$

$C_D$ = Drag coefficient

    = Profile drag + Parasitic drag
    = Pressure drag + Friction drag + Parasitic drag
$\rho$   = Air density [kg/m^3]
$V$  = Velocity [m/s]
$S$  = Wing surface area [m^2]


As angle of attack increases, $C_D$ increases as well as $C_L$.
- maximum $C_L/C_D$ ratio is called glide ratio
- for optimum flight, stay close to optimum glide ratio

*** Thrust and Weight

Engine types:
- piston engines
- turboprop
- turbojet
- turbofan
- ramjet

Fly regimes:
- high and slow: no option, not enough lift
- high and fast: civil aviation
- low  and slow: possible, high lift and low drag, small planes
- low  and fast: inefficient, military does anyway

- Aircraft empty weight:
  - structure
  - systems
  - crew
  - operating itmes
- Payload
- Fuel

** Lecture 4: Cockpits and Navigation
*** Cockpits
- 747 (1970). three persons in cockpit
- 747-400. glass cockpit
- circuit breakers to switch off individual systems
- mode control panel, central, auto pilot, height, direction
*** Instruments
Units:
- 1 nm = 1852 m nautical miles
- 1 ft = 0.3048 m altitude
- 1 kts = 1 nm/h = 1852m/3600s = 0.51444 m/s
- 1 ft/min = 0.3048m/60s = 0.00508 m/s (1500 ft/min regular speed)
- mach:

$M = \frac{V_{TAS}}{a}$ a = speed of sound

$a=\sqrt{\gamma R T}$  # speed of sound

$\gamma = 1.4$      # some constant

$R = 287.00J/kgK$

Measuring speed
- air speed
- ground speed
- pitot tube
- whole in the front: dynamic pressure
- opening in the side, static opening, lower pressure, static pressure

$P_{tot} = P_{st} + P_{dyn}$

$P_{tot} = P_{st} + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2$

- static pressure used to measure altutide
- static pressure also used to measure vertical speed
- air density is included, assumed to be constant
- equivalent air speed (EAS) with assumed rho at sea level
- true air speed (TAS)
- relationship between EAS and TAS:

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_{EAS}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho V_{TAS}^2$

$V_{TAS} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_0}{\rho}} V_{EAS}$

- in cockpit no conversion, EAS is show, because it's a measure for the
  dynamic pressure

39286.90249007389

*** Instruments II
Measuring altitude
- static pressure
- altitude: relative to sea level QNH
- flight level: uses standard reference of 1013.25 hPa QNE
- height: altitude above airport QFE
- altitude referes to altitude above sea level
- above the transition altitude, flight level (FL) are used
- flight levels, in 100ft, are relative to 1013.25 hPA

Examples
- FL085 means 8500ft above 101325 Pa
- 8500ft means 8500ft above sea level

Navigation
- difference between true north and magnetic north
- magnetic north pole wanders around
- maps and variation are updated yearly

What's our heading
- compass + deviation = magnetic
- magnetic + variation = true
- heading + wind = track
** Lecture 5: Structural Concepts
*** Early structures

| Period     | Structures                 | Materials          |
|------------+----------------------------+--------------------|
| 1903-1920  | cables, lath, fabric       | steel, wood, linen |
| 1910-1920  | truss, spar, ribs, fabrics | steel rods, tubes  |
| 1920-1940  | Load-carrying wooden wings | Wood               |
| 1932-today | Stiffened shell structures | Aluminium          |
| 1948-today | Pressure cabin             | Improved Al-alloys |
| 1980-today | Composite structures       | Carbon fibres      |

*** From truss to beam

- I-Beam
- Flanges

*** Shell structures
- Boeing and Dougles made first all metal aircraft 1935
- Rivets for joins
- load bearing skins
- monocoque - only load bearing skin
- semi-monocoque - with some supporting elements

Principal structure elements (PSE)
- principal structural elements, primary structure, carries loads,
  failure is catastrophic
- non-principial structural element, secondary structure, failure
  non-catastrophic, hatches, fairings

- Limit load: experienced once in a lifetime of a aircraft, no
  remaining damage allowed
- Ultimate load: limit load x safety factor (1.5), failure allowed
  after 3 seconds
- Failure behavior
- elastic behaviour, deformation reversible
- plastic behaviour, deformation permanent
- higher safety factor for composite than for metal alloy

*** Fatigue
Force equilibrium on hull:

$\Delta p = p_2 - p_1$

$2 \sigma t = \int(\Delta p \cdot R sin \phi)d\phi$

$2\sigma t = \Delta p \cdot 2 R$

$\delta_{circ} = \frac{\Delta p R}{t}$

$\Delta p$: pressure difference
$R$: radius of hull cylinder
$t$: thickness

$\sigma \cdot 2 \pi R \cdot t = \Delta p \cdot \pi R^2$

$\sigma_{long} = \frac{\Delta p R}{2 t}$

$\frac{\sigma_{circ}}{\sigma_{long}} = 2$

Fatigue
- due to repetetive loading
- load, smaller than breaking load, destroys parts
- failure stress for brittle aluminium reduces with number of cycles
- usually indication is cracks
- two limits: visibility limit (detection), criticality limit (failure)

Locations: Wings
- remous (wind variation)
- manoevres
- flaps, thrust

Location: Fuselage
- Pressurisation (once per flight)
- Wing loads

** Lecture 6: Stability and Control
*** Controls
Wing warping
Control surfaces

Flight controls:
- Thrust, speed control
- Ailerons, bank angle control
- Elevator, nose up/down pitchg
- Rudder, controls yawing movement, heading
- only 4 controls, but 6 degrees of freedom

Fly by wire:
- no direct connection between stick and control surfaces
- computer inbetween

*** Angles and Axes
Body axes
- Xb forward direction axes
- Yb wing on the right side
- Zb pointing down
- Xb rotation: roll or bank angle
- Yb rotation: pitch angle
- Zb rotation: yaw

Sing convention: negative deflection is positive aircraft response

Rudder
- yaw angle $\psi$
- rudder angle $-\delta_r$

Aileron
- roll angle $\phi$
- aileron angle $-\delta_{a,r}, -\delta_{a,l}$

Elevator
- pitch angle $\theta$
- elevator angle $-\delta_e$

Stability axes: $X_s$ attached to velocity
Body axes: $X_b$ attached to aircraft
Horizon reference
- climb angle $\gamma$: horizon -> airspeed
- angle of attack $\alpha$: airspeed -> aircraft
- pitch angle $\theta$: horizon -> aircraft

$\theta = \alpha + \gamma$

Top view (angles in clock direction):
- sideslip angle $\beta$: aircraft -> airspeed
- course $\chi$: north -> airspeed
- heading $\psi$: north -> aircraft

Moments:
- $M$ moment around Y axis, pitching moment
  positive pitching moment with nose up
- $L$ moment around X axis
- $N$ moment aroung Z axis

Lift formula:

$L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S$

Coefficient only depends on shape and angle of attack
*** Stability
Static stability
- positive (self-stabilizing)
- neutral
- negative (unstable)

Dynamic stability even if statically stable
- positive (damped)
- neutral (oscillation will keep amplitude)
- negative (oscillation will increase)

Integrators in the control loop, makes control harder
- mode 1: control speed, int -> x
- mode 2: control accelleration, int -> v -> int -> x
- mode 3: control change of acceleration, int -> a -> int -> v -> int ->x
*** Longitudal stability
- upward turbulence: $\Delta \alpha > 0$
- to get aircraft stable again, need $\Delta C_m < 0$

$C_{m_\alpha} = \frac{dC_m}{d\alpha} < 0$

- tail of aircraft can be pitched up with a trim wheel $i_h$
- trim used to get the total moment at center of gravity to zero
- downwash angle of tail $\epsilon$ slightly less

$\alpha_h = \alpha + i_h - \epsilon$

$\alpha_h$ : angle of attack at tail surface
$\alpha$: angle of attack at main wing
$i_h$: trim angle of tail surface
$\epsilon$: downwash angle due main wing changing the airflow direction slightly

$\frac{d\alpha_h}{d\alpha} = \frac{d}{d\alpha}(\alpha + i_h - \epsilon) = 1 - \frac{d\epsilon}{d\alpha}$

Aerodynamic centre:
- The point around whiche there is no change in moment due to a change
  in the angle of attack
- The moment stays constant for changing $\alpha$ at aerodynamic centre
- Lift might change due to angle of attack change
- nose up: positive moment

[[./longitudal-stability-1.png]]

Weight/Lift equation in equilibrium:

$W = L_{wb} + L_H = L$

Moment equation in equilibrium:

$\sum M_{tot} = M_{ac} + L_{wv} \cdot leg - L_H \cdot (l_H - l_{cg})$

$\sum M_{tot} = M_{ac} + L \cdot l_{cg} - L_H l_H = 0$

$C_m = \frac{M}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S c}$

$c$: average court, wing area divided by span

$C_m = C_{mac} + C_L \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - \frac{C_{L_H} \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S_H l_H}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S c}$

$C_m = C_{mac} + C_L \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - C_{L_H} \cdot V_H$ with

$V_H = \frac{S_H l_H}{S\cdot c}$ tail volume

$\frac{d C_m}{d \alpha} = 0 + \frac{dC_L}{d \alpha} \cdot \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - \frac{dC_{LH}}{d \alpha} \cdot V_H$

$C_{m_\alpha} = a \cdot \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - a_t (1 - \frac{d\epsilon}{d\alpha}) V_H < 0$

$a\frac{l_{cg}}{c} < a_t ( 1 - \frac{ d\epsilon} {d \alpha} ) V_H$

Total definition of longitudial stability:

$\frac{l_{cg}}{c} < \frac{a_t}{a} ( 1 - \frac{d \epsilon}{d \alpha} ) V_H$

when left and right part are equal: neutral point
$V_H$ is design parameter, it includes tail surface, distance to tail.

$V_H = \frac{S_H l_h}{S \cdot c}$

distance between neutral point and center of gravity is called static
margin. Can be changed by moving centre of gravity (all run to the
front of an aircraft). Static margin should be positive. This is true
for conventional aircraft. For canard aircraft there are some changes.

*** Aircraft oscillations
Phugoid
- up down movement
- period: 30 sec - several minutes
- low or no damping
- exchange kinetic and potential engergy
- modern airliners: low drag, low damping

Short period
- preriod: 2-5 seconds
- reaction on disturbance
- modern airliners: high damping

Dutch roll
- left right swing
- little damped

Spiral

Aperiodic roll
- result of vertical tail on top
** Lecture 7: Propulsion introduction
*** Intro
$V_0$: speed the air enters the engine, airspeed
$V_J$: exit speed

$V_j > V_0$ => thrust

Momentum
$I=mV$

$F = \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = \dot{m}\Delta V$

$T = \dot{m}(V_j - V_0)$

$\dot{m}$: Mass Flow in kg/s

$V_j - V_0$: speed change (m/s)

Engine types:
- human-powered
- electric
- airbreathing engines
  - prop
  - jet
- rocket

*** Airbreathing engines
Piston engine
- piston moves
- buring fuel causing pressure
- causes piston to move

$F = p \cdot A$

$A$: area of piston
$F$: force
$p$:  pressure on piston

$W = F \cdot s$

$W$ work
$s$ travelled way

$W = F \cdot \Delta x$
$W = p A \cdot \Delta x$
$W = p \cdot \Delta V$

$V$ Volume

$W = \int p d V$

Cycles:
- Intake
- Compression
- Combustion
- Expansion
- Exhaust

Area on p/V graph equals to amount of Work W

Aviation piston engines 
- 2 stroke engines *obsolete*
- 4 stroke engines *common*
- wankel engine *new*
- diesel engine *new*

Layouts:
- in-line engines
- radial engine
- boxer engine
- v-engine

*** Propeller theory
Convert shaft energy into propulsive energy

Increase efficiency
- counter-rotation
- variable pitch
- ducted fan

$V = \omega r$

$\omega$: rad/s

Useful force: T thrust
Loss: S side force (like drag)

Propeller pitch:
- speed varies
- angle of attack needs to vary as well
- variable twist
- adjustable pitch to accomodate different air speed

Propeller power

Work performed: $W = T \Delta s$ [J] = [Nm]

Power available: $P_a = \frac{T\Delta s}{\Delta t} = T \cdot V$ [J/s] = [W]

Brake (shaft) power: $P_{br}$

Propulsive efficiency: $\eta = \frac{P_a}{P_{br}} = \frac{T V}{P_{br}}$

$V$ is speed of the aircraft here

*** Jet engines
- continuous combustion
- intake -> compressed -> heated -> exapanded -> exhaust

Ramjet:
- air compressed due to airspeed
- not very efficient

Turbofan:
- compressor
- more compression
- more thrust due to move pV area

Turboprop/turboshaft
- turbine connected to propeller via gearbox
- loose some energy due to gearbox
- propeller more efficient than jet engine
- also used for helicopters

Turbofan
- extra fan in front of turbine
- some cold air bypasses turbine

Bypass ratio

$Bypass ratio B = \frac{Bypass airflow (cold)}{Core airflow (hot)} = \frac{\dot{m_c}}{\dot{m_h}}$

- more cold air
- less hot aur

Propulsive efficiency

In: $\frac{1}{2} \dot{m} V_0^2$

Out: $\frac{1}{2} \dot{m}V_j^2$

Jet Power: $P_j = \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} ( V_j^2 - V_0^2)$

Jet thrust: $T = \dot{m}(V_j - V_0)$

Power available: $P_a = T V_0$

Jet efficiency: $\eta_j = \frac{P_a}{P_j} = \frac{ T V_0} { \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} (V_j^2 - V_0^2) }$

Jet efficiency: $\eta_j = \frac{2V_0}{V_0 + V_j} = \frac{2}{1 + V_j/V_0}$

Efficiency:
- more mass flow
- lower exhaust speed
- much higher propulsive efficiency
- mixing of air also decreases noise level

Two or four engines:
- ETOPS: Extended Twin OperationS
- "engines turning or passengers swimming"
- due to higher reliability of modern engines
- twin engines restricted to maximum diversion time
- crossing some parts of atlantic and pacific ocean and the poles
  still restricted to four engine aircrafts

Future:
- even bigger engines
- turboprops, greener but noisier
- scramjet? not very efficient, but lower drag to outer atmosphere
  supersonic combustion ram jet -> scramjet
- specialization
